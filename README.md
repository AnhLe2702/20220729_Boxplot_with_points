# 20220729_Boxplot_with_points
Code to generate boxplots with points for datasets with groups and subgroups.
The data are organised as: 
Type: Chopped vs Intact explant
Each type has a few different positions: Explant I, II, III, IV etc. 
Each explant position was recorded in 10 different time points called Frame: Frame 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ,8, 9, 10 
Each Frame contains the record of the average area, circularity, solidity and perimeter for that explant at that particular time point of that particular type.
